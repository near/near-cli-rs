## User Guide

This guide is intended to give a detailed description of _near CLI_ and an
overview of its capabilities. This guide assumes that _near CLI_ is
[installed](README.md#installation)
and that readers have passing familiarity with using command line tools. This
also assumes a Unix-like system, although most commands are probably easily
translatable to any command line shell environment.

With _near CLI_ you can create, sign and send transactions in _online_ mode, which is enabled by default.
In _offline_ mode, you can create and sign a transaction. The base64 encoding transaction can be [signed](#sign-transaction---sign-previously-prepared-unsigned-transaction) or [sent](#send-signed-transaction---send-a-signed-transaction) later (even from another computer). To enter the _offline_ mode, you need to set the ```--offline``` flag in the command:
```txt
near --offline tokens \
    fro_volod.testnet \
    send-near volodymyr.testnet 0.1NEAR \
    network-config testnet \
    sign-later
```

Before proceeding to the description of specific commands, it is necessary to consider two points common to these commands:

1. Sign transaction

    _near CLI_ offers several ways to sign the created transaction. Let's take a closer look at each.

    - _sign-with-keychain - Sign the transaction with a key saved in the secure keychain_

        _near CLI_ stores and retrieves passwords in a secure OS storage. There _near CLI_ will independently find the access keys and sign the created transaction.

    - _sign-with-legacy-keychain - Sign the transaction with a key saved in legacy keychain (compatible with the old near CLI)_

        _near CLI_ will independently find access keys and sign the created transaction.
        Directory with access keys defined in [config](#config---manage-connections-in-a-configuration-file).
        The access keys must be in the _public-key.json_ file located in _/Users/user/.near-credentials/network-name/user-name/_
        For example, _/Users/frovolod/.near-credentials/testnet/volodymyr.testnet/ed25519_8h7kFK4quSUJRkUwo3LLiK83sraEm2jnQTECuZhWu8HC.json_

    - _sign-with-ledger - Sign the transaction with Ledger Nano device_

        This option involves signing the created transaction using a ledger.

    - _sign-with-plaintext-private-key - Sign the transaction with a plaintext private key_

        When choosing this signature option, _near CLI_ will ask the user to enter access keys:
        - "public_key":"ed25519:Ebx7...",
        - "private_key":"ed25519:2qM8..."

    - _sign-with-access-key-file - Sign the transaction using the account access key file (access-key-file.json)_

        When choosing this signature option, _near CLI_ will ask the user to enter the path to a file that contains information about account access keys.

    - _sign-with-seed-phrase - Sign the transaction using the seed phrase_

        When choosing this signature option, _near CLI_ will ask the user to enter the mnemonic phrase associated with the account.

    - _sign-later - Prepare unsigned transaction (we'll use base64 encoding to simplify copy-pasting)_

        This option involves signing the created transaction [later](#sign-transaction---sign-previously-prepared-unsigned-transaction).

2. Actions with a signed transaction

   _near CLI_ support for meta transactions as specified in [NEP-366](https://near.github.io/nearcore/architecture/how/meta-tx.html#meta-transactions). To create it, you just need to specify a _network_ that supports meta transactions. You can find out about such support in [config](#show-connections---Show-a-list-of-network-connections). The *meta_transaction_relayer_url* field is responsible for the ability to support meta transactions. For example:
   ```txt
   meta_transaction_relayer_url = "https://near-testnet.api.pagoda.co/relay"
   ```

   A signed transaction / meta transactions can be sent for immediate execution:

   - _send - Send the transaction to the network_

   or display in base64 format to send:

   - _display - Print only the signed transaction in base64 encoding. We will use it to send it later. ([Example](#send-signed-transaction---send-a-signed-transaction): near transaction send-signed-transaction 'EQAAAHZvb...' ...)_

#### reconstruct-transaction  - Use any existing transaction from the chain to construct NEAR CLI command (helpful tool for re-submitting similar transactions)

Let's consider an example when it is necessary to repeat a previously completed transaction:
```txt
near transaction \
    reconstruct-transaction GDoinMecpvnqahzJz9tXLxYycznL4cAoxKTPEnJZ3ank \
    network-config testnet
```

<details><summary><i>The result of this command will be as follows:</i></summary>

```txt
Transaction GDoinMecpvnqahzJz9tXLxYycznL4cAoxKTPEnJZ3ank:

signer_id:    volodymyr.testnet
receiver_id:  qweqweqwe.volodymyr.testnet
actions:
   -- create account:      qweqweqwe.volodymyr.testnet
   -- transfer deposit:    100 NEAR
   -- add access key:     
                   public key:   ed25519:AgVv8qjZ7yix3pTo7BimT1zoDYUSTGcg73RBssC5JMRf
                   nonce:        0
                   permission:   FullAccess

Here is your console command to run archive transaction. You can to edit it or re-run:
near transaction construct-transaction volodymyr.testnet qweqweqwe.volodymyr.testnet add-action create-account add-action transfer '100 NEAR' add-action add-key grant-full-access use-manually-provided-public-key ed25519:AgVv8qjZ7yix3pTo7BimT1zoDYUSTGcg73RBssC5JMRf skip network-config testnet

#### construct-transaction - Construct a new transaction

Let's consider an example when it is necessary to perform several actions within one transaction:
1. Create an account
2. Add access keys to the created account
3. Transfer tokens to the created account

To do this, we will use the transaction constructor:

#### sign-transaction - Sign previously prepared unsigned transaction

Consider an example of using the ability to create a transaction in _offline_:
1. Create a transaction.
2. When choosing how to sign a transaction, select the _sign later_ option and follow the instructions.
3. The displayed transaction in base64 format can be used here to sign it and/or send it later.

</details>

#### send-signed-transaction - Send a signed transaction

Let's look at the previous example, using the capabilities of sending a signed transaction:
1. Create a transaction.
2. Sign the transaction with your access keys.
3. Display the transaction on the screen in base64 format.
4. Send transaction.

</a>
</details>

#### send-meta-transaction - Act as a relayer to send a signed delegate action (meta-transaction)

Consider an example of using metatransaction functions:
1. Create a transaction.
2. Specify a _network_ that supports meta-transactions.
3. Sign the transaction with your access keys.
4. Display the transaction on the screen in base64 format and transfer it to the relay for sending.

Send signed delegated transaction:

- [delete-connection](#delete-connection---Delete-a-network-connection)

#### show-connections - Show a list of network connections

To view the data of the configuration file (_config.toml_), you can use the interactive mode or type in the terminal command line:
```txt
near config show-connections
```
