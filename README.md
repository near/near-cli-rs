# NEAR CLI

near CLI is your **human-friendly** companion that helps to interact with [NEAR Protocol](https://near.org) from command line.

Just run `near` and let it guide you through!

cargo install near-cli-rs
```

or, install the most recent version from git repository:

```bash
$ cargo install --git https://github.com/near/near-cli-rs
```

<details>
  <summary>Install on CI (GitHub Actions)</summary>

It is often desirable to use `near` CLI from CI to automate some actions, so here is an example of how you can make a function call during CI:

```yml
name: Release
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy-widgets:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Make a function call on mainnet
    env:
      NEAR_NETWORK_CONNECTION: mainnet
      NEAR_CONTRACT_ACCOUNT_ID: ${{ vars.NEAR_CONTRACT_ACCOUNT_ID }}
      NEAR_SIGNER_ACCOUNT_ID: ${{ vars.NEAR_SIGNER_ACCOUNT_ID }}
      NEAR_SIGNER_ACCOUNT_PUBLIC_KEY: ${{ vars.NEAR_SIGNER_ACCOUNT_PUBLIC_KEY }}
      NEAR_SIGNER_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY: ${{ secrets.NEAR_SIGNER_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY }}

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Install near CLI
      run: |
        curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/near/near-cli-rs/releases/download/v0.7.4/near-cli-rs-installer.sh | sh

    - name: Call some function
      run: |
        near contract call-function as-transaction "$NEAR_CONTRACT_ACCOUNT_ID" 'function_name_here' json-args '{}' prepaid-gas '100 TeraGas' attached-deposit '0 NEAR' sign-as "$NEAR_SIGNER_ACCOUNT_ID" network-config "$NEAR_NETWORK_CONNECTION" sign-with-plaintext-private-key --signer-public-key "$NEAR_SIGNER_ACCOUNT_PUBLIC_KEY" --signer-private-key "$NEAR_SIGNER_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY" send
```

You will need to configure GitHub Actions Secrets and Variables and once it is ready, this CI will only take a couple of _seconds_ to complete!

See how it is used by [DevHub]([https://github.com/near/devgigsboard](https://github.com/NEAR-DevHub/neardevhub-contract/blob/05fb66ac307d84347f29e8e3ab9f429a78cb6513/.github/workflows/release.yml#L30-L41)).

```bash
$ near
